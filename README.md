# Minecraft-Tools
Minecraft Tools for 1.13.1+ made in C#

Hello everyone my goal is to have an "all-in-one" free Minecraft tool, that could be used for anything Minecraft related.
Some of this things include:

- Pixel art generator with the highest quality available
- NBT viewer and editor (editor not yet implemented)
- Auto-backup system when using "write" features like the NBT editor on the selected worlds and related files
- 2D world viewer with dozens of maps
- 3D structure generator based on painting simple 2D images also creates mazes and other cool structures
- Banner and shield designer with image exporter even with it's recipes
- Slime chunks finder based on text or numeric seeds
- World seed infinite calculator (literally!), I generated my own GetHash() based on as string, which supports infinite bits
- Painted structures exporter (WIP), like the 3D structure will use simple 2D images and will export a sequence in 2D
- Thumbnail generator and avergae color finder for any image, useful for new textures or resizing images
- Finder of differences between Minecraft .JAR versions, will find what files have changed after a new update to save time
- Redstone designer that will export to new Minecraft worlds, not yet implemented
- Real time Minecraft world clock, shows several hard to find info about the time and weather and it's also very fun
- Block info viewer, kind of a mini block wiki offline, currently unfinished
- Automatic skin downloader, if you find a server with skins, you might get thousands of them automatically without being kicked
- Note blocks tuner, in the future will record sound and tell you on which note (and maybe instrument?) it's tuned
- Villager tradings viewer, kind of a little help offline like a mini wiki
- Entities info viewer, like the villagers info about all the entities, like damage dealt on all difficulties
- Resource structure rebuilder, copies all the sounds, etc from Minecraft with their original names on your desktop
- Paintings viewer, contains the original Minecraft paintings and also all the info about them, even with effects and filters
- Enchantment names viewer, converts text to the Standard Galactic Alphabet and vice-versa also emulates the enchanting table
- Secrets, like all the Xbox 360 resource packs and skins for PC (converted by myself, and 100 % without errors), etc
- And a lot of other planned tools in the near future, so please stay tuned for more...

It also contains a bit of publicity in it's menu, with links to the free music albums made by myself (JÃºpiter Mauro),
and 2 friends of mine, David Maeso and Fratelli Stellari. Finally it also includes an internal wiki about the Hermitcraft server and it's members.

Anyone is more than welcome to collaborate in this project and make it more perfect and bigger. I'm opened to listen any suggestion, although some things are difficult to make, so maybe you're the one that can help to improve it or add new features to it.

Also feel free to use any part of it's code in your own project, but please remember to give credit to me as the original author.

Note: the application shows English as it's language, but internally is programmed in Spanish, which is my country.

Thanks a lot for all your help and have a great day! ;-)
